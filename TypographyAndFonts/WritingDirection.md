Modern Japanese is a combination of kanji (logographic) and kana (syllabic), and can be written either vertical, top down, or  horizontal left to right.

Books are more often vertical, but other modern content forms, particularly web, are more likely to be horizontal left to right.

Korean Hangul, a writing system designed by scholars, can also be written either horizontally or vertically.

English is normally written horizontal left to right, but can be vertical with three variants.

With non-rotated glyphs:

T    
o    
p    
    
D    
o    
w    
n    
    
WIth glyphs rotated 90° left, bottom up, and with glyphs rotated 90° right, top down.

These vertical english variants are not suitable for long passages, and are used mainly for signage or labels.
