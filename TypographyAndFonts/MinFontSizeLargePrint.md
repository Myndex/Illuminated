## Minimum Font Size
WCAG 2 AA does not have a minimum font size for 4.5:1, but there is a minimum for 3:1 contrast, 24px normal or 18.8px bold. There are several exceptions such as for brand names and logos (a concession to allow brand colors that may otherwise be rejected), and for inactive elements and incidental text, all of which are allowed with no contrast minimum.

ISO standards do indicate minimum sizes, as does the [APC-RC public working draft](https://readtech.org/ARC/).


## Standard and Large Print

- The de-facto standard for print has been 11pt to 12pt (15-16px), but as small as 8 or 9pt for newsprint (11-12px) this is a minimum readability. 

- Large print is commonly 18pt (24px) which is where WCAG 2 derives the 24px breakpoint.
    - Large and giant print books are available from 16pt to 24pt (21px to 32px) with some even as large as 36px (48px). 
    - The physical print industry is concerned with the economics of paper, ink, etc.
    - On the web itâ€™s more about screen space and convenience (scrolling). 
        - By the numbers, if someone with standard vision needs 16px, someone with low vision at 20/100 needs 80px for the same readability, _at the same distance to screen_.
        - This is why it is important to never restrict text zoom, and to ensure that everything works if zoomed 500%.
