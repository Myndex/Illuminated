## What Is Chromaticity

By chromaticity, we typically are referring the xy coordinates on the chromaticity diagram, the outer rim of which is the spectral locus, which presumably defines the extent of the human gamut of color vision.

The values were derived from matching experiments, wherein subjects looked at a test target, half of which was a defined monochromatic color, and the adjacent half was a color created by mixing three "primary" lights (red green blue). The subject would adjust the primary light intensities until a visual match was achieved such that the left and right half of the visual target were indistinguishable.

Thus, chromaticity coordinates refer to a tri-stimulus match to a "pure" color in an isolated environment, with no other context.

The $CIE\ XYZ$ space provides coordinates wherein $X+Y+Z=1$, and $Y = luminance$.

In the diagram below, the $XYZ$ space is projected to create this $xyY$ space, where the chromaticity is the $xy$ coordinate on this chart, and the $Y$ is luminance (not shown).

**Thus, luminance $Y$ and chromaticity $xy$ fully define a _measured_ color.**



Color _perception_ is different. Color perception implies the perceived color in the **_context_** of specific lighting and other colors of the design or environment, and not in isolation, and not in terms of "matching to find a null".
