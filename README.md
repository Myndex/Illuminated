# Illuminated ðŸ’¡
A repo collecting the more substantial comments Myndex made regarding typography, CSS, color, contrast, and vision.

## Background
Most of the comments are from discussions related to the 2019 thru 2023 research cycle for APCA and related work. This repo is a work in progress, and some of what is in here are early research notes and discussions. Where the ultimate conclusion or specific opinion may have shifted since it was originally written, as new information came to light, may not always be brought up to date (a work in progress).

There are also informative files as [Gists][1], at the [APC-Readability Criterion][2], my [TangledWeb blog][3] the [Myndex Resources Catalog][4]. The files here in this repo are mainly [Markdown][5], and will eventually be merged/organized into either a Wiki format or similar web-based work. Please start a discussion in the discussions area if you have any questions or comments.

**_Please do not copy or fork without written permission._**     
The files here are under review to ensure accuracy, so at this time I would much prefer not forking, but please feel free to link to any as references.
