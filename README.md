# Illuminated
A repo for collecting all the very long comments Myndex made regarding color, contrast, and vision.

Most are related to the 2019 thru 2023 research cycle. This repo is a work in progress, and some of what is in here are early research notes and discussions, where the ultimate conclusion or specific opinion may have shifted since it was originally written, as new information came to light.

Please start a discussion in the discussion area if you have any questions or comments.
